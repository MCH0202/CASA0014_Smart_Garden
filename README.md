# ðŸŒ± Smart Plant Monitoring System
## Project Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop an Arduino-based intelligent plant monitoring system to achieve real-time monitoring and visual feedback of plant growth environment. By integrating multiple sensors (LDR, temperature and humidity sensors), the system is able to collect the environmental parameters around the plants (including light intensity, air temperature and humidity) and transmit the data to the Chrono Lumina Light by using the MQTT protocol. the colour change of the light will reflect the plant's growing environment condition, which will help the user to better understand and improve the plant's growing conditions.
